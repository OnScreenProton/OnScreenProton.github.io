* Update

I am currently alive and well and have been working on upgrading on my vps setup. Over the past few months I've found a few new pieces of software such as [trilium notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) and [memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos) that seem pretty cool. I've also set foot into the world of federated social media with new accounts on [Mastodon](https://wetdry.world/@onscreenproton) and [lavafish](https://leathallava.land/@onscreenproton). Both of these seem pretty interesting and I hope to stay active on both.

That's pretty much it for now and I hope to have something else to put here sometime soon. I'm just thinking about what else I should put here
