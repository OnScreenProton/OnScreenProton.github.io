It was mostly not my work since I took a lot of the site from <a href=\"https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog\">the example blog</a> and from a layout from <a href=\"https://teppyslayouts.neocities.org/\">teppy</a>, but I put some small finishing touches on my self. Hopefully I have the motivation to continue writing here, but even if I don't, I at least know this blog is mine.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<h1>Update</h1>\n<p>I am currently alive and well and have been working on upgrading on my vps setup. Over the past few months I've found a few new pieces of software such as <a href=\"https://github.com/zadam/trilium\">trilium notes</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/usememos/memos\">memos</a> that seem pretty cool. I've also set foot into the world of federated social media with new accounts on <a href=\"https://wetdry.world/@onscreenproton\">Mastodon</a> and <a href=\"https://leathallava.land/@onscreenproton\">lavafish</a>. Both of these seem pretty interesting and I hope to stay active on both.</p>\n<p>That's pretty much it for now and I hope to have something else to put here sometime soon. I'm just thinking about what else I should put here</p>\n",

I rebooted this for no reason other than I felt like it. I'm not really sure what I'll put here, but I guess I'll find out later. As I wrote in my intro thing for this site, I don't really know a ton about programming at all, but maybe I'll have motivation to learn more if I find a project I want to work on.</p>\n<h2>Misc.</h2>\n<p>If you are going to contact me, I'm not really active on any platform other than Discord, so that would be perfered.</p>\n",
